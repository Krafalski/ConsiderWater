##### Issues:

- when a new user is crated, there is no notification of success or rerouting, right now, the same page shows, like nothing even happened

- give error with create a new user if problem

- need a field for email when creating a new user
- need to add validation for email for the model

- give error with log in if problem

- need to change the view when the user clicks their own name
- move the user delete to somewhere else?

- when a user is logged in, you still see the sign up link

- need a better redirect when user creates a new journal entry

- any user can see all the journal entries

- user id not being added to journal entries
